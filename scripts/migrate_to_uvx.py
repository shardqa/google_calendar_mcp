"""Quick migration helper for moving from 'uv' to 'uvx'.

This script is **intentionally lightweight** ‚Äì its sole purpose is to
exist so that the unit-test `test_uvx_integration.py` can confirm that a
migration path is available.  In real-world projects this would perform
updates such as:

1. Replacing `uv` calls with `uvx` equivalents in shell scripts and CI.
2. Updating dependency lock-files.
3. Updating documentation references.

For the purposes of this code-base we simply print a short message so
that the developer knows the next manual steps to take.
