# Intelligent Scheduling System

## Business Rule

Enable users to request automatic agenda scheduling based on their current tasks
and commitments. The system should analyze existing calendar events and task
lists, then propose optimal time blocks for task completion.

## Core Functionality

### Primary Use Case

User request: "Schedule my tasks for this week based on my current agenda and priorities"

### System Response Process

1. **Read Current State**
   - Fetch all calendar events for specified time period
   - Retrieve all pending tasks from Google Tasks
   - Analyze task priorities, deadlines, and estimated durations

2. **Intelligent Analysis**
   - Identify available time slots in calendar
   - Order tasks by priority algorithm (deadline + importance)
   - Match task duration requirements with available time blocks
   - Consider user preferences (work hours, break intervals)

3. **Schedule Proposal**
   - Generate time block suggestions for each high-priority task
   - Create calendar events for proposed task blocks
   - Provide scheduling rationale and alternatives

## Algorithm Specifications

### Priority Calculation

```python
priority_score = (deadline_urgency * 0.4) + (user_importance * 0.3) + \
                 (estimated_effort * 0.3)
```

### Time Block Matching

- Minimum task block: 30 minutes
- Maximum continuous work block: 2 hours
- Buffer time between tasks: 15 minutes
- Respect existing calendar commitments

## MCP Commands

### `schedule_tasks`

**Input Parameters:**

- `time_period`: "week" | "day" | "month"
- `work_hours_start`: "09:00"
- `work_hours_end`: "18:00"
- `max_task_duration`: 120 (minutes)

**Output:**

- List of proposed calendar events for tasks
- Scheduling summary with rationale
- Alternative time slots for each task
